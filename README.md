# MockMate: Rapid Mock API Generation

## Overview

MockMate is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to accelerate frontend development by providing an intuitive GUI for quickly launching mock APIs. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, MockMate lets you prototype and test your frontend code without waiting for the backend to be ready. It serves as a companion service to [Calla](https://github.com/Calla-lang), offering seamless transitions from mock APIs to production code.

## Features

### Core Functionality

#### GUI-Based API Management
- Intuitive, user-friendly GUI for creating, managing, and editing mock APIs.

#### Data Types and Validation
- Real-time validation of data types, modeled closely after the DSL schema in [Calla](https://github.com/Calla-lang).

#### Error Handling
- Robust error-handling mechanisms, harmonized with the features available in [Calla](https://github.com/Calla-lang).

### Advanced Features

#### Import/Export Types
- Import type definitions from your codebase or export them to align both frontend and backend development.
  
#### Database Connection
- Optional feature to connect your database for more realistic mock data.

#### Seed Data Upload
- Quickly populate your mock APIs by uploading seed data in JSON or CSV formats.

### Monetization

#### Free Tier
- Limited to 3 endpoints with manual data input.

#### Paid Plans
- Solo, Team, and Enterprise subscription levels with various advanced features.
  
## Integration with Calla

MockMate is designed to work hand-in-hand with [Calla](https://github.com/Calla-lang). The same DSL and type definitions can be reused, allowing for a seamless transition from a mock API to actual production code. MockMate can generate configurations that are directly usable by Calla's code generation utilities, making the whole development cycle more efficient.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples will be available to ensure that MockMate is easy to adopt and extend.

## Conclusion

MockMate aims to be a game-changer in the realm of frontend development by providing rapid, easy-to-use mock API creation features. When used in conjunction with [Calla](https://github.com/Calla-lang), it offers a complete end-to-end solution for accelerated, reliable, and efficient software development.
